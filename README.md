A basic implementation of the BBC News app built using React Native, the project helped with understanding how react native works, and how to begin building real apps with it.

The app uses the same BBC News API as the official one, but is subject to change at any time so could break at any time.

The app parses the BBC's XML story structure and maps each item to react components.
The app defaults to the topic of world news,pressing the topics under stories will laod those feeds, a way to view specific news feeds will be implemented soon.

Supports:
- Videos  
- Images  
- Text
- External Links  

To-do:  
- Internal article links  
- Select a news feed topic


The app is currently iOS only, but I would like to expand to android in the future.

## Setup for developing

- git clone this repo  
- run `npm install`
- run the app from Xcode
